## Getting Started

First, to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# you could also use pnpm, yarn, or bun instead of npm
# (and you probably should)
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

With the server in dev mode, the page auto-updates as you edit the files.

To format the code, run:

```bash
npm run format
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
